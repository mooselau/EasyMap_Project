# EasyMap_Project
This is a location-searching web application written in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) based on a pre-downloaded database and [Google Maps](www.google.com/maps).
It is designed to be a web app to help local people check more locally necessary government location-related information. And it shows the usage and recent popular searches on the home page, and it is platform-friendly, the data and the map all displayed well on different platforms.

## Disadvantages
While, I have to say this is a imperfect application at current stage, as it has many aspects to imporve.
- FIRST and the foremost, the user-interface should be more clear and clean. Customers should be easily get to know what this app is and what is might aim to do. A clean web application is more likely appealing to people and makes it simple enough to run and display.
- Second, the navigation area needs more work. Since the navigation is the first thing people usually get to interact with, so the navigation should be more simple and clear, that is, tha navi tells the people what this app can do and how to do.
- (for the future) There can be more to be done on Google maps, as the data all display on the map, so how to make the map more friendly to people is a crucial point.
- (for the future) Additionally, the database should be automatically grab necessary information from the resources website. Dev can get rid of manually updating data again and agian by doing so, and the app, as a result, will be available and usable all the time.
